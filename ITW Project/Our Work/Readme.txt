INSTRUCTIONS:-

1. The Code is executed already and the input and output of the code is stored in "ITW Project.ipynb" file.
2. As the code requires atleast 1 hour to optimize the code using the tpot regressor so use jupyter to open that file.
3. The snapshots of the codes are also stored in "Snapshots.doc".
